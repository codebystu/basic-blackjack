# Basic Blackjack
This is an interactive front end website using HTML CSS and Javascript, it is a basic blackjack game simulator where a single player takes on a computer controlled dealer and tries to increase their bankroll by betting on the outcome of the hand and deciding whether to stand on their current hand or hit and take an additional card in an attempt to be closer to a score of 21, without going over.
The live site can be found [here](http://codebystu.github.io/msp1-tshg-final)

## UX

### Colour Scheme
The starting point for colour scheme choice was the green beize type color, reminiscent of a card table in a casino [Coolor Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/2d4219-faebd7). 

### Typography

I used [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) to select

## Features
### Existing Features


- _Custom 404 page_
    - This feature gives an error message on a page styled in the theme of the rest of the site, with a link to get the user back to the main landing page. Useful to users who follow a broken link or if they encounter some other error, they can get back to the main site easily.
